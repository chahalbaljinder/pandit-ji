## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
```
src/
├── app/           # Next.js app router
├── components/    # React components
│   ├── ui/       # Reusable UI components
│   └── features/ # Feature-specific components
├── lib/          # Utility functions
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
├── api/          # API routes
└── types/        # TypeScript types/interfaces
```

### 2. Security Measures
- Implement rate limiting for API routes
